Linux Perl readme.txt

This directory has been added at the request of Linux users of z390.
It includes Perl commands developed by Martin Ward to process bat files on Linux.
Unfortunitly I no longer have access to Unbuntu or other Linux system for testing.
The z390_v1701 distribution has only been tested on Windows 10.  
Volunteers to help test z390 on Linux and Apple OSX would be greatly appreciated.
