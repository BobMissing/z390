List of RPI-issues resolved per version of z390
===============================================

V1.6.00b01
   RPI 1209   Prepare z390 for OPTABLE/MACHINE support
              - Move array op_trace_type to tz390
              - Replace static content of arrays op_name, op_code,
                op_type, op_trace_type with same data generated from op_tables array
   RPI 1209A  Implement OPTABLE/MACHINE options
              Report OPTABLE contents if LIST specified on OPTABLE or MACHINE

V1.6.00b02
   RPI VF01   Add vector options Vector/Novector and SectionSize, PartialSums

V1.6.00b03
   RPI 1209G  Table op_type_len is now created dynamically from opcode_formats
              Opcodes can be defined with either the number of the opcode format (as before)
                 or with the name of the opcode format. The latter is now used for Vector operations
   RPI 1209B  (work in progress)

   RPI 1522   Load Logical Immediate instructions and other RI-a instructions should issue error when argument is relocatable

V1.6.00b08
   RPI 1522   Remaining RI-a instructions and trace logic for RI-a instructions repaired

V1.6.00B09
   RPI 1527   TROO, TRTO, TROT, TRTT will process 1 character if length 0 is specified
   RPI 1529   Incorrect character x'92' in ascii character translation tables (backquote, should be quote = x'27')
   RPI 1528   Linker sets entry point incorrectly: An ENTRY with offset 0 is overridden by the last END statement's offset
   RPI 1523   START with non-zero origin is starts location counter at 0 anyway
   RPI 1531   MVCL and MVCLE with source length zero abend

V1.6.00b10
   RPI 1533   Invalid codepage option is not flagged as an error. Should cause abortion.
   RPI 1526   Add support to test mode for V (Verify) command
   RPI 1530   CLIJ incorrectly tests its operands

V1.6.00b11
   RPI 1515   BSM with odd target address should set amode64, not jump to odd address
   RPI 1544   Change test-mode command PSW to display PSW with key 8, rather than 0.
   RPI 2000   Add test-mode command AR to display one or all access registers
   RPI 2001   BSM: changes for set branch address & amode 64;
              BASSM: remove redundant if statement
   RPI 2002   BASR, BAL, BAS: make EXecute aware and amode 64 aware;
              BAL: cc,ilc,pgm mask put in return address for amode 24
   RPI 2003   Add support for LAM, LAMY, STAM, and STAMY instructions
   RPI 2004   Add support for TAM instruction
   RPI 2005   Allow test-mode commands PSW and PSW+ to have leading and trailing spaces
   RPI 2006   Test-mode L command in 24-bit mode: errors listing above the line storage
   RPI 2007   Test-mode command "1r=x'8000000000000000'" fails (java bug); R1=-1 anyway
   RPI 2008   Add test-mode command PSW16 to display 16 byte PSW
